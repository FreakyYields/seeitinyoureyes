# Dex++ - Debugging Suite
![Logo](/logo.png)

## Script
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AZYsGithub/DexPlusPlus/refs/heads/master/out.lua"))()
```

## What's the difference between Dex and Dex++?
Since the original Dex is the last release and Moon have discontinued it, it still have missing features such as "Click part to select" for example.
Dex++ will take over the legacy of Moon's Dex and addig missing features.
Here is the features and stuffs were added/fixed in Dex++
- Console Output
- Click part to select (thx Toon :3)
- CodeFrame cursor offset (where cursor on textbox were not aligned properly)

## Notes
- Still on initial release, expect bugs!

## To Build
1. Ensure you have Python 3 (I use 3.9.0)
2. Run build.py
3. The executable script will be created as out.lua


## Missing stuff from old Dex
Features that existed in old Dex that I didn't get to make. These should be the first things you add if you plan to continue / edit this.
- ~~Click to select~~
- Saving (instance specific in right click menu, and a menu for whole map saving)
- Settings menu
