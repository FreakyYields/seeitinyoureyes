# Dex++
![Logo](/logo.png)
Dex++ is a revival of Moon's Dex, made to fulfill Moon's Dex prophecy.

## Script
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AZYsGithub/DexPlusPlus/refs/heads/master/out.lua"))()
```

## What's the difference between Dex and Dex++?
Since the original Dex is the last release and Moon have discontinued it, it still has some missing features such as "Click part to select".
Dex++ will take over the legacy of Moon's Dex and adding missing features.
Here are the features that were added/fixed in Dex++
- Console Output
- Model Viewer
- Revived Save Instance
- Click part to select (thx Toon :3)
- CodeFrame cursor offset (where cursor on textbox were not aligned properly)

## Notes
- Still on initial release, expect bugs!

## To Build
1. Ensure you have Python 3 (I use 3.9.0)
2. Run build.py
3. The executable script will be created as out.lua

## Missing stuff from old Dex
Features that existed in old Dex that I didn't get to make. These should be the first things you add if you plan to continue / edit this.
- Settings menu
